# Capsule-Networks
My try at implementing a capsule network from the paper: [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf)

In an attempt to better understand Capsule Networks, I have set out on my own to build a capsule network using Tensorflow and help from youtube videos. Through this process, I believe I have gotten a much better understanding of how capsule networks can be implemented.

Data & results are excluded from repository because of the size.
